# C-Language-File-IO-Student-Management-System

The Student Management System (SMS.C) is a quintessential project written in Standard C, focusing on Structured Programming and Persistent Data Storage via binary file I/O. Data is managed using a struct named Student, which aggregates related information. The system implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Search) functionality by performing direct operations on the students.dat binary file. The most technically significant part of this program is the update_student() function, which uses the fseek function to precisely navigate the file pointer, allowing for the overwriting of an existing record in placeâ€”a critical C file handling technique. To ensure robust operation, the code includes a necessary cleanup_input_buffer helper function to handle common input stream issues when mixing scanf (for numbers) and string reading (for names/majors). This project is essential for any programmer learning C and the intricacies of low-level data persistence.
